    "description": "In class 57, you learned about “Switch Navigation”. You coded for a multi-screen app where you could press a button to navigate to a different screen. You also learned how to pass data from one screen to another screen using props\n\nIn this project, you will apply your learning to create a Newsletter App, which will contain multiple screens and users can click on different buttons to get to different screens."
